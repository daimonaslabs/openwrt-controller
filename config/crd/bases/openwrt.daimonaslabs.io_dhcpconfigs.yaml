                      description: |-
                        Dnsmasq is designed to choose IP addresses for DHCP clients using a hash of the client's MAC address.
                        This normally allows a client's address to remain stable long-term, even if the client sometimes allows
                        its DHCP lease to expire. In this default mode IP addresses are distributed pseudo-randomly over the
                        entire available address range. There are sometimes circumstances (typically server deployment) where
                        it is more convenient to have IP addresses allocated sequentially, starting from the lowest available
                        address, and setting this parameter enables this mode. Note that in the sequential mode, clients which
                        allow a lease to expire are much more likely to move IP address; for this reason it should not be
                        generally used.
